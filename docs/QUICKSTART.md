   }
   ```

2. **Create a note**

   ```bash
   POST /api/notes/create
   {
     "subjectId": "your-subject-id",
     "title": "Cell Structure",
     "rawContent": "Cells are the basic units of life. They contain a nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell membrane. Mitochondria produce energy for the cell through cellular respiration."
   }
   ```

3. **Process with AI**

   ```bash
   POST /api/notes/{noteId}/process
   ```

4. **Generate a quiz**
   ```bash
   POST /api/learning-tools/generate
   {
     "type": "QUIZ",

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "API key not configured"

→ Add `TOGETHER_API_KEY` to `.env` and restart

### "AI usage limit exceeded"

→ User has reached their plan limit. Upgrade plan or wait for reset.

### Slow responses

→ Normal for first request. Subsequent requests are faster.

### Rate limit errors

→ Too many requests. Implement retry with backoff.
